# Modpack leftovers
Here are some various files that may help with any kind of LiL related tinkering for minecraft

## Contents
- `3d` contains BlockBench folders of me trying out the software and Yes Steve Model.
- `LiLAmethyst` Resource pack that updates an older LiL resource pack focusing more in the GUI.
- `LiLAmethyst_gfiefiles` Source files that can be opened with GreenFish Icon Editor.
- `pythongen` Origins mod datapack generator script, it's pretty incomplete, just for someone with curiosity about what I was trying to do.
- ~~`Emoji stuff` Mess of datapack files that should go with Emojiful and similar mods, also a lists of servers that were fine with the modpack using their emotes~~ Removed for containing large amounts of zip files
- `PROMO` Silly assets used to hype this project, also some FancyMenu assets.
- `lildim` Some idea of making a city dimension, but I wasn't convinced with the textures, also the world generation coding looked overwhelming.

## What's out of this

- All the splashes that I recompiled
- Discord bots where some are just lame
- A working modpack, since that work isn't mine
- References (not my work)
- Base bbmodel, anyone can do something better
- Small generic texures
- Video demos (Maybe I'll leave the discord server to someone)
- KubeJS file to register blocks/items (Just missing lol)
- xi2fiw.7z (Baka's resource pack)
- archive.zip (silly origin folder)
