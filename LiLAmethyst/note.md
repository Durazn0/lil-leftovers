# LiL amethyst GUI
Hello, Curanto here, this is my incomplete resource pack intended to use for a modpack that I've never finished. Maybe you will find some useful ideas, and history through this pack (Check credits below!)
I hope whoever wants to take in any minecraft related project finds some help from this.
